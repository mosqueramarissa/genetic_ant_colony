# genetic_ant_colony

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive solution to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using three distinct optimization approaches: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and a GA with K-means. The system efficiently routes vehicles to serve customers with geographical coordinates while respecting vehicle capacity constraints.
